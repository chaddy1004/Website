          As a junior hardware enineering in Agfa Graphics, I was mainly in charge of creating hardware changes on the printers that are being developed in the factory.
          The manufacturing factory was directly connected to the office, meaning that I was able to gain hands on experience in assembling, test the changes that I made directly, as well as see the new machines that had my changes implemented.
          Aside from making design changes and fixing problems, my manager gave me handful of projects which involved making test fixtures for easier testing of certian QA protocols.
          This job allowed me to gain a lot of hands on experience and look at impact of design from the assembly/manufacturing point of view. Through shadowing a technician, I learned proper methods of cable management, crimping, soldering, and schematic reading.

      Our company at that time utilized Jira to manage the tasks that are needed to be completed. We were able to choose which tasks that we wanted to take care of, some wre very minor and some were rather impactful.
      So`me minor tasks that I had to handle were things like add more grounding to certain component, or update the schematic
